Map file: setting up our < key > to compile it in < value >.
    This file have only one function: "SET" which accepts key::value as argument.
    Example:
        SÅT key::value; ( and we can use "key" in file, which defined in < input > argument. ...
            ... This "key" will be compiled in "value". )
    There's no "commentary" function / character(s). All that you writing is commentary, excepts "SET" function.
